• Generate SSH keys for the user student on serverb. Do not protect the private key with
   a passphrase.
  ==>   ssh-keygen 
       Enter file in which to save the key (/home/student/.ssh/id_rsa): /home/ student/.ssh/review3_key : /home/ student/.ssh/review3_key

   ==> ssh-copy-id -i .ssh/review3_key.pub student@servera

  ==> ssh student@servera


* On servera, configure the user student to accept logins authenticated by the SSH key pair you created for the user student on serverb. 
  The user student on serverb should be able to log in to servera using SSH without entering a password.

   ==>  ssh -i .ssh/review3_key student@servera

* • On serverb, configure the sshd service to prevent users from logging in as root via SSH.

          ==> sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config  
          ==> parameter PermitRootLogin  no           :wq
     ==> sudo systemctl reload sshd.service

* On serverb, configure the sshd service to prevent users from using their passwords to log in. Users should still be able to authenticate logins using an SSH key pair.
    
     ==> sudo vim /etc/ssh/sshd_config 
     ==>  PasswordAuthentication no               :wq
        ==> sudo systemctl reload sshd.service

 * Create a tar archive named /tmp/log.tar containing the contents of /var/log
on server

     ==>  sudo tar -cvf /tmp/log.tar /var/log

 * Remotely transfer the tar archive to the directory /tmp on servera, authenticating as student using /home/student/.ssh/review3_key as the student user’s private key of the SSH key pair for authentication.

  ==>  scp -i .ssh/review3_key /tmp/log.tar student@servera:/tmp



* Configure the rsyslog service on serverb to log all messages it receives that have the priority level of debug or higher to the file /var/log/grading-debug. 
This configuration should be set in an /etc/rsyslog.d/grading-debug.conf file which you should create.

       ==> sudo vim /etc/rsyslog.d/grading-debug.conf          wirte     *.debug /var/log/grading-debug     :wq

      ==> sudo systemctl restart rsyslog.service

*|Install the zsh package, available in the BaseOS repository, on serverb.

       ==>   sudo yum install zsh -y

* Enable the default module stream for the module python36 and install all provided
  packages from that stream on serverb.

        ==> sudo yum module install python36 -y

* Set the time zone of serverb to Asia/Kolkata.

        ==> sudo timedatectl set-timezone Asia/Kolkata
