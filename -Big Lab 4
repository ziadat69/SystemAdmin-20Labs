* Determine the name of the Ethernet interface and its active connection profile 

 ==> nmcli device status

* create a new connection profile called static for the available Ethernet 
   interface that statically sets network settings and does not use DHCP


	==> nmcli connection add con-name static type ethernet \

  ==> nmcli connection up static

On serverb, edit the /etc/hosts file to set client-review4 as the canonical host name for the IPv4 address 
   192.35.22.11 of the hostziadat69.com.


   ===> sudo vim /etc/hosts 
     192.35.22.11/24 ziadat69.com  client-review4


* Use the ping command to verify that you can reach  192.35.22.11 using the canonical host name client-review4. 

    ==> ping -c4 client-review4

* Use the nmcli command to add the new IP address.

     ==> sudo nmcli connection modify static +ipv4.addresses ' 192.35.22.88/24'

* Use the nmcli command to activate the new IP address.
