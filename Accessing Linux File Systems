File Systems and Mount Points 

1) The following example displays the file systems and mount points on host.
    ==> df

2) Show a report on the file systems on the host system with all units converted to human-readable format

   ==> df -h

3) Show a disk usage report in human-readable format for the /usr/share directory on host:

  ===> du -h /var/log

4) Use the lsblk command to list the details of a specified block device or all the available devices.

   ==> lsblk

5) The following example mounts the file system in the /dev/vdb1 partition on the directory /mnt/ data.

    ==> mount /dev/vdb1 /mnt/data

6) The lsblk -fp command lists the full path of the device, along with the UUIDs and mount points,
    as well as the type of file system in the partition

    ==> lsblk -fp

7) To unmount a file system, the umount command expects the mount point as an argument.

     ==> umount /mnt/data

SEARCHING FOR FILES

8) Search for files with passwd in the name or path in directory trees readable by user on host.

      ==> locate passwd

9) The -i option performs a case-insensitive search. With this option, 
    all possible combinations of upper and lowercase letters match the search.

    ==> locate -i messages

10)  Search all files in the /var/lib directory that are owned by the chrony user.

   ==> sudo find /var/lib -user chrony

11) List all files in the /var directory that are owned by root and the group owner is mail.

    ==> sudo find /var -user root -group mail

12)  List all files in the /usr/bin directory that has a file size greater than 50 KB.
  
    ==>  find /usr/bin -size +50k

 13) Search all files in the /home/student directory that have not been changed in the last 120 minutes.

     ==> find /home/student -mmin +120

14) List all the block device files in the /dev directory.

     ==>  find /dev -type b







• Storage devices are represented by a special file type called block device.
• The df command reports total disk space, used disk space, and free disk space on all mounted regular file systems.
• The mount command allows the root user to manually mount a file system.
• All processes need to stop accessing the mount point in order to successfully unmount the
device.
• The removable storage devices are mounted in the /run/media directory when using the graphical environment.
• The find command performs a real-time search in the local file systems to find files based on search criteria.
