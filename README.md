 # 1) Accessing the Command Line 
 - Log in to a Linux system on a local text console and run simple commands using the shell.
 - Save time by using tab completion, command history, and command editing shortcuts to run commands in the Bash shell.

# 2) Managing Files From the Command Line
 - Copy, move, create, delete, and organize files while working from the Bash shell.
 - Describe how Linux organizes files, and the purposes of various directories in the file-system hierarchy.
 - Specify the location of files relative to the current working directory and by absolute location, determine and change your working directory, and    list the contents of     directories.
 - Create, copy, move, and remove files and directories.
 - Make multiple file names reference the same file using hard links and symbolic (or "soft") links.
 - Efficiently run commands affecting many files by using pattern matching features of the Bash shell.
   
# 3) Getting Help in Red Hat Enterprise Linux
  - Reading Manual Pages
  - Resolve problems by using local help systems.
  - Find information in local Linux system manual pages.
  - Find information from local documentation Info.
    
# 4) Creating, Viewing, and Editing Text Files
   Create, view, and edit text files from command output or in a text editor.
   - Save command output or errors to a file with shell redirection, and process command output through multiple command-line programs with pipes.
   - Create and edit text files using the vim editor.
   - Use shell variables to help run commands, and edit Bash startup scripts to set shell and
     environment variables to modify the behavior of the shell and programs run from the shell.

# 5) Managing Local Users and Groups
   Create, manage, and delete local users and groups and administer local password policies.
  - Describe the purpose of users and groups on a Linux system\
  - Switch to the superuser account to manage a Linux system, and grant other users superuser
    access using the sudo command.
  - Create, modify, and delete locally defined user accounts.
  - Create, modify, and delete locally defined group accounts.
  - Set a password management policy for users, and manually lock and unlock user accounts.
    
# 6) Controlling Access to Files
   Set Linux file-system permissions on files and to interpret the security effects of different permission settings.
  - List the file system permissions on files and directories, and interpret the effect of those permissions on access by users and groups.
  - Change the permissions and ownership of files using command-line tools.
  - Control the default permissions of new files created by users, explain the effect of special permissions, and use special permissions and default permissions to set
  -  the group owner of files created in a particular directory.
    
# 7) Monitoring and Managing Linux Processes
  Evaluate and control processes running on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux system.
  - Get information about programs running on the system so that you can determine status, resource use, and ownership, so you can control them.
  - Use Bash job control to manage multiple processes started from the same terminal session.
  - Control and terminate processes that are not associated with your shell, and forcibly end user sessions and processes.
  - Describe what load average is and determine processes responsible for high resource use on a server.
    
# 8) Controlling Services and Daemons
   Control and monitor network services and system daemons using Systemd.
   - List system daemons and network services started by the systemd service and socket units.
   - Control system daemons and network services, using systemctl.

# 9) Configuring and Securing SSH
   Configure secure command-line service on remote systems, using OpenSSH.
   - Log in to a remote system and run commands using ssh.
   - Configure key-based authentication for a user account to log in to remote systems securely
     without a password.
   - Restrict direct logins as root and disable password-based authentication for the OpenSSH service.
     
# 10) Managing Networking
   Configure network interfaces and settings on Red Hat Enterprise Linux servers.
  - Describe fundamental concepts of network addressing and routing for a server.
  - Test and inspect current network configuration with command-line utilities.
  - Manage network settings and devices using nmcli.
  - Modify network settings by editing configuration files.
  - Configure a server's static host name and its name resolution, and test the results.
    
# 11) Installing and Updating Software Packages
   Download, install, update, and manage software packages from Red Hat and Yum package repositories.
  - Register a system to your Red Hat account and assign it entitlements for software updates and support services using Red Hat Subscription       
    Management.
 - Explain how software is provided as RPM packages, and investigate the packages installed on the system with Yum and RPM.
 - Find, install, and update software packages using the yum command.
 - Enable and disable use of Red Hat or third-party Yum repositories by a server.
 - Explain how modules allow installation of specific versions of software, list, enable, and switch module streams, and install and update packages     from a module.

# 12) Archiving and Transferring Files Archive and copy files from one system to another.
  Archive and copy files from one system to another.
- Archive files and directories into a compressed file using tar, and extract the contents of an existing tar archive.
- Transfer files to or from a remote system securely using SSH.
- Synchronize the contents of a local file or directory with a copy on a remote server.

# 13) Analyzing and Storing Logs
Locate and accurately interpret logs of system events for troubleshooting purposes.
- Describe the basic logging architecture used by Red Hat Enterprise Linux to record events.
- Interpret events in relevant syslog files to troubleshoot problems or review system status.
- Find and interpret entries in the system journal to troubleshoot problems or review system status.
- Configure the system journal to preserve the record of events when a server is rebooted.
- Maintain accurate time synchronization using NTP and configure the time zone to ensure correct time stamps for events recorded by the system    journal and logs.
